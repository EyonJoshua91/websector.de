<a href="http://www.websector.de/games/tetris/">"WS-Tetris"</a> is a Flash game based on the classic puzzle game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">"Tetris"</a>. I designed and programmed "WS-Tetris" in December 2004 and it seems that this kind of games has never lost its popularity, because it's being played by folks <a href="http://www.gvisit.com/map.php?sid=30c06f3e9941fc52a1f3cbd884c7904e">from all over the world every day</a>.
