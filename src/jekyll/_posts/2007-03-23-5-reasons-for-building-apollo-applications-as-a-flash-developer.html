<p>Well, 5 reasons aren't enough ;) and as a Flash Developer you'll need experience with ActionScript 3 and Flex 2, too. However, <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/apollo/">Apollo Alpha</a> is out of the door and after studying the open book <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Apollo:Books:Apollo_for_Adobe_Flex_Developers_Pocket_Guide">"Apollo for Flex Developers"</a> I've found my personal top 5 reasons for diving into Apollo as a Flash Developer:</p>

The <code>HTMLControll</code> class inherits the <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/2/langref/flash/display/DisplayObject.html"><code>flash.display.DisplayObject</code></a> class, which you can manipulate HTML content like any other display object with applying filters, using matrix for transformations to scale, rotate or skew. Furthermore it's possible to manipulate the HTML DOM from ActionScript.</li><li>Script bridging between Flash and JavaScript without browsers incompatibilities.</li><li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/entitlement/index.cfm?e=labs_apollo">Apollo SDK</a>: You can use any tool of your choice (e.g. <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>) to start developing Apollo applications - for free.</li></ol></p><p>Great, isn't it?</p>
