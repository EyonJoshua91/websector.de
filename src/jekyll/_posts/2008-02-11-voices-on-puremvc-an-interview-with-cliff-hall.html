<p>Cliff Hall, the founder of the <a href="http://puremvc.org/">PureMVC project</a>, has recently opened a Blog called "Voices on PureMVC" and has started a "Voices Podcast", too. </p>
<p><a href="http://puremvc.org/content/view/70/1/">At the first episode</a> we've talked about some PureMVC demos I've created as well as about the experiences using PureMVC in my professional work. It was a lot of fun!</p>
