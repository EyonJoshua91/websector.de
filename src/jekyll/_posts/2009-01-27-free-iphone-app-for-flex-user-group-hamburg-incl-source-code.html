<p style="background-color: #F6F6F6"><strong>[UPDATE 02/11/09]</strong> flexughh app is available on iTunes store! All links has been updated. Get it for free ;)</p>

It's done! My first iPhone app is uploaded to <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/">Apple's app store</a>. It's an app for the <a href="http://www.flexughh.de">Flex UG in Hamburg / Germany</a>, called "flexughh". Because I'm very excited about all the enthusiastic <a href="http://www.xing.com/net/flexughh/">flexughh-members</a> I decided to offer this app for free including its full source code written in Objective-C as open source! 

Today I will present the new flexughh app <a href="http://www.flexughh.de/2009/01/07/flexughh-meeting-27012009-alger-werft-einfuhrung-in-blazeds/">at our flexughh-Meeting</a>. If you don't have the chance to attend it, here are some screen shots.
