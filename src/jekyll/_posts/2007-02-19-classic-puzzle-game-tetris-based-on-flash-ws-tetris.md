["WS-Tetris"](http://www.websector.de/games/tetris/) is a Flash game based on the classic puzzle game ["Tetris"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris). I designed and programmed "WS-Tetris" in December 2004 and it seems that this kind of games has never lost its popularity, because it's being played by folks [from all over the world every day](http://www.gvisit.com/map.php?sid=30c06f3e9941fc52a1f3cbd884c7904e).
