WSSkinStatesTester is a handy tool to test visually all states of any skin classes in Flex 4 (Gumbo).

<!--more-->

Imagine you as a Flex developer or a designer have been created a lot of skins for your application, e.g. using Flash Catalyst. Now you want to check the behavior of these skins changing its states. Therefore you will run your application to change different states of components or you open Flash Catalyst to check all the states of a skin. Or you could use Flash Builders design view for this issue, but unfortunately it is unable to show transitions switching between states.

Anyway, how about switching between skin classes and all its states (incl. transitions) using only one (test-) view?
