It's done! My first iPhone app is uploaded to [Apple's app store](http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/). It's an app for the [Flex UG in Hamburg / Germany](http://www.flexughh.de), called "flexughh". Because I'm very excited about all the enthusiastic [flexughh-members](http://www.xing.com/net/flexughh/) I decided to offer this app for free including its full source code written in Objective-C as open source!

Today I will present the new flexughh app [at our flexughh-Meeting](http://www.flexughh.de/2009/01/07/flexughh-meeting-27012009-alger-werft-einfuhrung-in-blazeds/). If you don't have the chance to attend it, here are some screen shots.
