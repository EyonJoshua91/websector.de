<p>Today I had an issue with skinning a ComboBox. Within a Flash form a ComboBox should be highlighted with a red border for displaying an error, but I couldn't use ComboBoxes <code>"borderStyle"</code> property to solve this issue.</p>

<p>It took me several minutes to figure out how to do the simplest of things. I've dug out <em>mx.controls.ComboBox</em> and its super classes detecting a TextInput named <em>"text_mc"</em> located in <em>mx.controls.ComboBase</em> which draws the border.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>First you have to point to <em>"text_mc"</em>. ComboBox supports this reference with <code>comboBoxInstance.textField</code>. Change its default <code>"borderStyle"</code> named <code>"dropDown"</code> to <code>"solid"</code> for skinning the border. Then just customise the style called <code>"borderColor"</code>:</p>
<phpcode>
<?php 


	$sourceUrl = 'http://www.websector.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/20/snippet1.txt';

	$codeExample = new CodeViewer();
	$codeExample->showCode($sourceUrl);	

?>
</phpcode>
<h2>Result</h2>
