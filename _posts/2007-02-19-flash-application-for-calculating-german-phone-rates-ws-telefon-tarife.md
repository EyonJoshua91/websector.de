Long time ago (in September 2003 ;-) ) I designed and developed a Flash based application called ["WS-Telefon-Tarife"](http://www.websector.de/telefon/tarife.php) for calculating German phone rates. The idea behind was to provide an online application for a friend, who calculated the best rates for saving money. For administrating data I developed an content management system as well.
