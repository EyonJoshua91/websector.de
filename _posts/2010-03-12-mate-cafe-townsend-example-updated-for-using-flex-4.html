For an upcoming Flex 4 training I do need a good example for using <a href="http://mate.asfusion.com">Mate framework</a>. At the moment you will find <a href="http://mate.asfusion.com/page/examples">a lot of examples on Mate's official website</a> or at the project called "<a href="http://code.google.com/p/mate-examples/">mate-examples</a>" at  Google Code. But it seems that there is not any Flex 4 example available. 

Anyway, I just ported the <a href="http://mate.asfusion.com/page/examples/cafe-townsend">current Cafe Townsend example (Flex 3)</a> created by <a href="http://www.asfusion.com">Laura Arguello</a> to Flex 4. 

<!--more-->

It was not a big deal, because Mate supports already Flex 4. Only few changes was necessary for using new Spark components.

Also I did some little modifications in <code><a href="http://code.google.com/p/mate-examples/source/browse/trunk/examples/cafeTownsendFlex4/src/com/cafetownsend/maps/MainEventMap.mxml">MainEventMap.mxml</a></code> to start all Inject properties for any views as soon as possible listening to <code>FlexEvent.PREINITIALIZE</code>. Furthermore all presentation models now are not created before its view will be added. But that is what we called "cosmetic" ;) , because Laura has already done an awesome job building the Flex 3 example of Cafe Townsend!

<h2>Live example</h2>
<strong>[Update 03/15/2010]</strong> For a better use case of Flex 4 I have refactored the original code of the app. Now it based on a new layout and uses some effects. Last but not least the code implement a LocalEventMap to encapsulate the handling of employes, which is important if you want to use a modular app with Flex-Modules<strong>[/Update]</strong>

(To view source code just a right mouse click on the app)
