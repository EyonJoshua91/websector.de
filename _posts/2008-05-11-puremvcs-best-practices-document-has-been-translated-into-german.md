It's done! It takes me few days to translate the great documentation called "PureMVC - Implementation, Idioms and Best Practices" published by [Cliff Hall](http://futurescale.com/) into German. Anyway, it was worth it! 52 pages about using [PureMVC](http://puremvc.org/) in a right way including examples, tips and general information using [design patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns).

<!--more-->

Study this document published in [English, France and now in German](http://puremvc.org/), and you will have the perfect knowledge about building well structured applications based on [Flash](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/), [Flex](http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/) or [AIR](http://www.adobe.com/products/air/) using [PureMVC](http://puremvc.org/). Believe me, you don't have to dig tons of resources, blog entries or forums, just study this document!

Grab the the "Best Practices" at the [official PureMVC site](http://puremvc.org/)! The German version will be there available within the next few days as well.
