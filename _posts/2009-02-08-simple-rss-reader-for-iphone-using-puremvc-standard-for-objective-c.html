Few weeks ago Cliff Hall <a href="http://puremvc.org/content/view/121/1/ ">announced the release of PureMVC Objective-C Port</a> by <a href="http://starterstep.wordpress.com">Brian Knorr</a>. Brian also provided a very helpful demo called "<a href="http://trac.puremvc.org/Demo_ObjectiveC_UIKit_EmployeeAdmin">Employee Admin</a>".

To dive into the Objective-C port of PureMVC as quick as possible I have built a another demo. It's a pretty simple RSS reader for iPhone or iPod touch, which grabs a feed of a blog and shows the latest 10 entries in detail.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Brian Knorr, the project owner of the Objective-C port of PureMVC, did an awesome job! But the question is: Do I need a MVC framework such as PureMVC for developing an iPhone app? You don't! Because Objective-C based already on a MVC paradigma. 

However, if you are new to Objective-C and you may have a strong ActionScript background using PureMVC, it might be a good choice to dive into iPhone development. And you will see, that the code architecture is like your home ;)
