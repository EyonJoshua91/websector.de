Cliff Hall, the founder of the [PureMVC project](http://puremvc.org/), has recently opened a Blog called "Voices on PureMVC" and has started a "Voices Podcast", too.

[At the first episode](http://puremvc.org/content/view/70/1/) we've talked about some PureMVC demos I've created as well as about the experiences using PureMVC in my professional work. It was a lot of fun!

P.S. Cliff, thanks for the great interview! I'm very proud to be a voice of PureMVC ;)
