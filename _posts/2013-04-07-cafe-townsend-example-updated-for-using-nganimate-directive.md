These days the team of AngularJS introduces the new [`ngAnimate`](http://code.angularjs.org/1.1.4/docs/api/ng.directive:ngAnimate) directive to support CSS3 Animations.

After reading the fantastic overview ["Animation in AngularJS"](http://www.yearofmoo.com/2013/04/animation-in-angularjs.html) by Matias Niemel√§
it took me just few minutes to implement `ngAnimate` into Cafe Townsend. And it was just fun, because `ngAnimate`
directive is really easy to use.

To get a feeling about the animations just check out the following short video on YouTube:
